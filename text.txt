Nuno finally on Jota: "Liverpool are going to have a great player and boy, and Ki has a bright future ahead of him. We think this deal is good for everybody. Diogo was really happy here, but it's normal that players like to face new challenges."
But Josh Shonibare levelled proceedings a short while later before a fortuitous goal from Jack Stretton just beyond the half-hour mark decided the outcome of the Premier League 2 fixture.
A strong start nearly saw the visitors go ahead after 45 seconds when Ben Woodburn poked just wide from Liam Millar's cross. But they wouldn't have to wait too long for the opener to arrive.
With Leighton Clarkson also hovering over the ball, Cain took responsibility from a free-kick in a central area.
The midfielder proceeded to fire in a whipped left-footed strike into the top corner, kissing the post en route to the back of the net.
